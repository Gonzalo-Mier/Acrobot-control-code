# Acrobot-control-code

This is the source code I used in my master thesis. The PDF with the thesis can be found [here](http://oa.upm.es/47905/)

The paper published with the results can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.3390/inventions2030016)

In this work, I develop new techniques to control an acrobot, an undercontrolled robotic arm of 2 dof.
